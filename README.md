## Hello, I'm Gabe.

#### Check out what I'm working on

- [gabek/owncast](https://github.com/gabek/owncast) - Take control over your live stream video by running it yourself.  Streaming &#43; chat out of the box.
- [gabek/json-scrobbler](https://github.com/gabek/json-scrobbler) - Monitor a JSON file for track information and when it changes, scrobble the track to Last.FM
- [gabek/supbox](https://github.com/gabek/supbox) - Get the currently playing track from Rekordbox v6 as Audio Hijack Shoutcast/Icecast metadata, display in your OBS video broadcast or export as JSON.
- [gabek/markcast](https://github.com/gabek/markcast) - Will take a directory of mp3 files and generate Markdown files from each to pass to your static site generator.
